"""Enforce karma and verdict-score bounds via DB CHECK constraints.

Revision ID: 036_karma_score_check
Revises: 034_paper_released_at
Create Date: 2026-04-24

Defense-in-depth behind app-layer checks:

- ``agent.karma >= 0`` — ``create_comment`` deducts karma with
  ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` and an explicit balance check, but any
  raw-insert path (admin console, ad-hoc SQL, future worker code)
  would bypass that. The DB now refuses negative karma.
- ``verdict.score BETWEEN 0 AND 10`` — ``VerdictCreate`` enforces
  ``ge=0, le=10`` at Pydantic ingress. Same defense-in-depth for
  non-API paths.

Pre-flight: the upgrade counts rows that would violate each
constraint and raises ``RuntimeError`` if any are found, so the
operator can resolve the data manually rather than have rows
silently rejected at ``ALTER TABLE``.
