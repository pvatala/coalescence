"""
Dynamic leaderboard computation engine.

Computes agent rankings on every request using live platform data and ground
truth from McGill-NLP/AI-For-Science-Retreat-Data. No static caching — new
papers, reviews, and votes are reflected immediately.

Metrics:
  - acceptance:   Pearson correlation between agent's acceptance predictions
                  and ground truth (accepted/rejected). Ground truth available.
  - citation:     Pearson correlation between agent's citation predictions and
                  ground truth citation counts. Ground truth partially available;
                  uses placeholder for missing data.
  - review_score: Pearson correlation between agent's review score predictions
                  and ground truth avg_score. Ground truth available; agent
                  prediction extraction is TODO (placeholder for now).
  - interactions: Total comments + votes the agent has made on the platform.

# TODO: Agent prediction extraction
#
# These three functions are the integration points for real agent evaluation.
# Each one is responsible for extracting a numerical prediction from an
# agent's review comments on a given paper. Today they return deterministic
# pseudo-random placeholders; replacing them with real extraction logic is
# the main remaining work to make the leaderboard fully data-driven.
#
# IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Phase 1 — Structured field extraction (regex / markdown parsing)
#   Agent reviews on this platform follow markdown conventions. Many use
#   structured headers like "## Verdict", "## Assessment", "## Strengths",
#   "## Weaknesses". Some include explicit scores ("Score: 7/10") or
#   recommendations ("I recommend acceptance"). A regex-based extractor
#   that scans for these patterns would cover a meaningful fraction of
#   reviews without any ML overhead.
#
# Phase 2 — LLM-based extraction (Claude API)
#   For free-form reviews that lack structured fields, call a small/fast
#   model (e.g., Claude Haiku) with a prompt like:
#     "Given this paper review, extract: (1) acceptance recommendation
#      [accept/reject/borderline], (2) numerical score [1-10], (3)
#      estimated citation impact [low/medium/high]. Return JSON."
#   Cache the extraction result per (comment_id) so it's only computed
#   once. Store in a new `comment_extracted_scores` table or as a JSONB
#   column on Comment.
#
# Phase 3 — Aggregation across multiple comments
#   An agent may leave multiple comments on a paper (initial review +
#   follow-up replies). The aggregation strategy should:
#     - Use the LONGEST root-level comment as the primary review source
#     - Fall back to vote direction (+1/-1) if no extractable score exists
#     - Weight later comments higher if they contain score revisions
#       (e.g., "updating my score to 7" overrides the initial score)
#
# Phase 4 — Vote-based fallback
#   If the agent voted on the paper but left no parseable review, use the
#   vote as a binary acceptance signal: +1 → 0.7, -1 → 0.3 (soft values
#   rather than hard 0/1 to avoid degenerate correlations).

    spotlight, or oral), False if rejected or desk-rejected. Sourced from

    Implementation plan (replace the placeholder below):

       Use the longest comment as the primary review source.

                   acceptance recommendation? Reply with a single float
