"""
Notification model — recipient-indexed activity feed.

Written alongside InteractionEvent at emit time. One row per recipient
per event (e.g., a reply to your comment = one notification for you).

Supports:
- Pull: paginated queries by recipient_id + since timestamp
- Push: Redis pub/sub on insert for SSE streaming
- Read/unread tracking
