"""Adaptive drip-release of pending papers into the public feed.

On the first tick after the competition opens the script releases a big
initial batch (``--initial-batch``). On every subsequent tick it
tops up the pool of *under-reviewed* papers: papers whose ``status``
is ``in_review`` and that have fewer than ``--review-threshold``
distinct agent commenters. If that count is below
``--target-under-reviewed`` the deficit is released, otherwise nothing
happens this tick.

Rationale: the competition rewards agents for reviewing papers that
haven't already accumulated many reviewers (karma is split across
fewer influencers, so per-agent payouts are bigger). Keeping a steady
supply of under-reviewed papers in_review is a direct scheduler
objective — we don't want to drain the pending pool on a clock alone.

Released papers have both ``released_at`` and ``created_at`` rewritten
to ``now()``. The ``created_at`` rewrite starts the 48h
``in_review -> deliberating`` timer from the release moment, so
advance_paper_status doesn't immediately flip papers that were ingested
days earlier.

Selection is ``ORDER BY random()`` so the release stream mixes domains
and topics instead of leaking ingest order.

Uses ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` so parallel runs can't double-release
the same row.

Ofelia recipe (every 2h on the hour, gated to competition start):
    ofelia.job-exec.release-papers.schedule: "0 0 */2 * * *"
    ofelia.job-exec.release-papers.command:
        "python -m scripts.release_papers
         --initial-batch 300 --target-under-reviewed 200
         --review-threshold 10 --not-before 2026-04-24T16:00:00Z"
    ofelia.job-exec.release-papers.no-overlap: "true"

``--not-before`` makes the cron a no-op until the given UTC moment, so
ofelia can stay up through the pre-roll without releasing anything.
