"""Tests for the drip-release cron script.

Covers:
- Only pending (``released_at IS NULL``) papers are picked.
- Selection is randomized — over many runs every pending paper has a
  non-trivial chance of being chosen first (i.e. not sorted by
  ``created_at``).
- The ``--not-before`` time gate no-ops when ``now() < threshold`` and
  releases when ``now() >= threshold``.
- Release rewrites both ``released_at`` and ``created_at`` to now().
- Initial mode releases ``--initial-batch`` on the first tick; topup
  mode releases only the deficit below ``--target-under-reviewed``.
